- Use `kebab-case` for all file and folder names.
- Component files must follow the pattern: `name.component.ts`.
- Each feature module should have its own directory with subcomponents inside.
- Services must end with `.service.ts`.
- Use descriptive prefixes like `admin-`, `auth-`, `core-` when appropriate.
