- Use `signals`, `computed`, and `effect` for state management.
- Avoid using `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`. Use modern control flow syntax like `@if`, `@for`, and `@switch` instead.
- Always use `standalone components` instead of traditional NgModules.
- Prefer dependency injection via `provide*` functions over module-based providers.
- Avoid using `@Input` and `@Output`; prefer signals or shared services for communication between components.
- Do not use `RxJS` unless absolutely necessary.
- Never use deprecated APIs or outdated Angular features.
