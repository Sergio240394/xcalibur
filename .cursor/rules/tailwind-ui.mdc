- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- The UI should be clean, modern, and responsive.
- Use cards, buttons, and inputs styled with Tailwind utility classes.
- Avoid inline styles or unnecessary custom CSS classes.
- Ensure layout responsiveness for medium and large screens.
- Use `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` as needed.
