- Create a skeleton for an Angular 20+ application using `standalone components`.
- Implement an `AppComponent` that includes a fixed sidebar for navigation.
- Use Angular Router to navigate between modules.
- Each menu item should link to a route that loads an empty placeholder view (e.g., 'Coming soon').
- Create one module per functional area of the system (e.g., accounts receivable, treasury, accounting), but leave them empty for now.
